# Welcome to Computational Economics whith Julia

Teachers: [Rodrigo Caputo](https://sites.google.com/a/fen.uchile.cl/rodrigo-caputo/) and [Félix Ordóñez](https://foj-0.github.io/felixordonez/)


## Objectives of this Course 
This course aims to study economic models and understand their foundations based on computational applications developed in [Julia]( https://julialang.org/). The approach is practical: start with an economic problem, select an appropriate numerical technique to analyze it, apply the technique to the problem, and present the findings.

The choice of programming language is relevant. Julia is a modern, high-performance programming language designed for scientific computing and data manipulation. Originally developed by computer scientists and mathematicians at MIT under the leadership of Alan Edelman, Julia combines three key features for highly intensive computing tasks, perhaps like no other contemporary programming language: it is fast, easy to learn and use, and open source. Among its competitors, C/C++ is extremely fast and the open-source compilers available for it are excellent, but it is difficult to learn, particularly for those with little programming experience, and cumbersome to use, for example, when creating prototypes of new code. Python and R are open source and easy to learn and use, but their numerical performance can be disappointing. Matlab is relatively fast (though less so than Julia) and is easy to learn and use, but is quite expensive to purchase (and its age is starting to show).

## Prerequisites 
- Intermediate knowledge of microeconomics, macroeconomics, and mathematics is required. 
- No prior programming knowledge is necessary. 
- This is a graduate level course in Computational Economics.
- You need a laptop. 
- You need a [Github](https://github.com/) account. 

## Evaluation
The learning methodology will be conducted in three parts: first, the basic knowledge of the programming language will be covered; then, solving an economic model, transferring it to Julia, and analyzing the results; and finally, optimizing the code.

- Evaluation part 1 (project/test): 20%
- Presentation of paper/code: 20%
- Programming of paper/code: 30%
- Evaluation part 2 (project/exam): 30%
